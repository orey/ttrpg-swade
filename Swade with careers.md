# SWADE Career System
*Inspired by Barbarians of Lemuria*

## Overview
This system replaces SWADE's traditional skill system with broader careers that represent a character's background and training. Each career encompasses multiple related abilities and provides both mechanical benefits and narrative guidance.

## Career Mechanics

### Career Dice
- Careers use the same die types as SWADE skills (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12)
- Starting characters get 12 points to distribute among careers

### Using Careers
When making a roll that would normally use a skill:
1. Player describes how their career applies to the situation
2. GM determines if the career is applicable and at what level:
   - **Direct Application**: Use full career die
