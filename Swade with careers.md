# SWADE Career System
*Inspired by Barbarians of Lemuria*

## Overview
This system replaces SWADE's traditional skill system with broader careers that represent a character's background and training. Each career encompasses multiple related abilities and provides both mechanical benefits and narrative guidance.

## Career Mechanics

### Career Dice and Linked Attributes
- Careers use the same die types as SWADE skills (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12)
- Each career is linked to a primary attribute for advancement costs
- Starting characters get 12 points to distribute among careers
- Career advancement follows SWADE rules (cheaper when below attribute, expensive when above)
- Maximum starting career die is d10 (d12 with Hindrance points)

### Using Careers
When making a roll that would normally use a skill:
1. Player describes how their career applies to the situation
2. GM determines if the career is applicable and at what level:
   - **Direct Application**: Use full career die
   - **Indirect Application**: Use career die -1 step
   - **Tangential Application**: Use career die -2 steps
   - **Not Applicable**: Use d4-2 or find another approach
